# An Evaluation of Different Hyperparameter Tuning Methods

## Description:
This contains the codes for evaluate Genetic Algorithm and Particle-Swarm Optimization in optimizing SVM hyperparameters. Tests on sci-kit learn synthetic datasets and real dataset, benchmark again grid search.

## Requirements:
- pyswarms
- geneticalgorithm 
- Matplotlib

---
## Content:
-Method Implementation:
	- Define and implemented Grid Search, Genetic Algorithm and Particle-Swarm Optimization for experiment purposes

-Generate Synthetic Data:
	- Define different methods to generate synthetic dtaset

-Experiment:
	- Compare performance of GA and PSO in tuning SVM's hyperparameters (cost and gamma)

-Combination of GS and GA in real dataset:
	- 'Warm-start' GA on real dataset

### Files
- ModifiedGA.py: contains modified GA implementation
- presentation: Beamer slides
